                    <p class="text news-title">Changes Coming to the Pokémon TCG with <em>Sword & Shield</em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Card errata, rule changes, and more are coming with the introduction of the new
                        Pokémon TCG: <em>Sword & Shield</em> Series.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">The introduction of a new series to the Pokémon Trading Card Game is always
                        an exciting time, and the Sword & Shield Series is no exception. Pokémon V and Pokémon VMAX are
                        here to shake up the game, and lots of brand-new Pokémon are making their debut in the Pokémon
                        TCG. Additionally, there are some changes to existing rules and mechanics on the way. Let's take
                        a look at them.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Rule Change: First Turn</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">At the start of the <em>XY</em> Series, a rule was introduced to prevent the
                        player
                        who goes first from attacking on the first turn. Starting on February 21, 2020 (the date that
                        Pokémon TCG: <em>Sword & Shield</em> becomes legal for tournament play), there will be an
                        additional
                        restriction: the player who goes first cannot play a Supporter card on the first turn.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">This change is an attempt to make it less of an advantage to go first. Some
                        strategies may benefit when the player goes second, but others might work out better if the
                        player goes first. We hope this results in interesting choices in both gameplay and deck
                        building.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">Please also note that Pokémon TCG: <em>Sword & Shield</em> Prerelease events
                        will be
                        played using this rule.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Weakness and Resistance</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">For over a decade (all the way back to the <em>Diamond & Pearl</em> Series),
                        Resistance has meant that a Pokémon takes 20 less damage from attacks of the listed type.
                        However, Pokémon introduced in the <em>Sword & Shield</em> Series have a Resistance of -30
                        instead of
                        -20.</p>
                    <img class="news-img"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/trading-card-game/_tiles/swsh01/rules/inline/01-en.png"
                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content">For example, Zacian V has a -30 Resistance to Grass-type Pokémon. Any
                        Pokémon from a previous
                        series that has a -20 Resistance will continue to be treated that way—follow what's written on
                        the card.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">Weakness is unchanged, but a few of the common type matchups have shifted.
                        This won't apply to every Pokémon, but here are some of the general changes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="news-content"><strong>Water-type Pokémon:</strong> Weakness to Lightning instead of
                            Grass</li>
                        <li class="news-content"><strong>Psychic-type Pokémon:</strong> Weakness to Darkness instead of
                            Psychic</li>
                        <li class="news-content"><strong>Darkness-type Pokémon:</strong> Weakness to Grass instead of
                            Fighting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="news-content">You may also find that some types of Pokémon have a Resistance that they
                        didn't have in the past. Be on the lookout for these changes to Weakness and Resistance!</p>

                    <p class="small-title">Type Rearrangement</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">The Fairy type, which was introduced in the <em>XY</em> Series, will no
                        longer be
                        supported in the <em>Sword & Shield</em> Series. Pokémon that are Fairy types in the Pokémon
                        video game
                        series will now generally be represented as Psychic-type Pokémon in the Pokémon TCG. To maintain
                        a balance among types, Pokémon that are Poison types in the video games will now be represented
                        as Darkness types instead of Psychic types. For the time being, basic Fairy Energy can still be
                        used in the Standard format, but that may change in the future.

                            However, you can't mix the two steps—for example, you can't add Poison damage, then apply an
                            Ability, and then go back to check if a Pokémon is still Asleep.</li>

                        For
                        example, the card Potion says, “Heal 30 damage from 1 of your Pokémon.” Prior to that, it would
                        have said, “Remove 3 damage counters from 1 of your Pokémon.”</p>
                    <p class="news-content">For the <em>Sword & Shield</em> Series, a similar term will be introduced
                        for effects
                        that remove Special Conditions. Going forward, this term will be “recover.” As an example, the
                        card Pokémon Center Lady has been updated in <em>Sword & Shield</em> to say “Heal 60 damage from
                        1 of
                        your Pokémon, and it recovers from all Special Conditions.” It still has the same effect, but
                        now the word “recover” can be associated with Special Conditions just like “heal” is associated
                        with damage.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Reminder Text Removal</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">In the past, Abilities that could be used during your turn included the
                        reminder text “<em>(before your attack)</em>” to clarify that attacking was the last thing you
                        could do
                        in a turn. Starting with <em>Sword & Shield</em>, that reminder text won't appear anymore. In
                        some cases,
                        that reminder text could cause the text to be incorrect, since there are some Abilities that can
                        be used during the effects of attacks. For example, if you use Persian-GX's Slash Back-GX attack
                        and switch it with Heatran-GX, Heatran-GX's Burning Road Ability activates when it becomes
                        Active, even though that happens during the attack. To prevent this confusion altogether, this
                        reminder text will be removed in the <em>Sword & Shield</em> Series.

                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">You may notice that cards from the <em>Sword & Shield</em> Series have a
                        white box containing a letter in the bottom-left corner (for example, all cards in the <em>Sword
                            & Shield</em>
                        expansion have a “D” mark).</p>

                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content">This is called a regulation mark, and it will be used in the future to
                        determine which cards are legal to use in tournament play. For example, there might be a point
                        in time when only cards with a “D” regulation mark can be used in the Standard format. This
                        change will get more attention in the future, but for now, just take note that it's there.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">There are lots of new things to learn in the Pokémon TCG: <em>Sword & Shield</em>
                        Series! This is only the beginning, and there may be more changes and updates as more expansions
