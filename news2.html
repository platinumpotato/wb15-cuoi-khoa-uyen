                        Adventure
                    </p>
                    <p class="news-content"><em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em> has arrived for Nintendo
                        Switch,
                        bringing back a different type of Pokémon adventure that a lot of Pokémon fans might not be
                        familiar with. This game has you—as a Pokémon—exploring ever-changing dungeons, rescuing
                        Pokémon, battling enemy Pokémon, and collecting treasures.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">This guide will help you with choosing the perfect partner, preparing for
                        battle, determining effective tactics, and anticipating environmental hazards, like dangerous
                        trap tiles, varying terrain, and extreme weather conditions. </p>

                    <p class="news-content">At first, the gameplay might seem somewhat simplistic, but as the topics
                        mentioned above suggest, there's quite a bit of depth here. Basic strategies might get you
                        through the early stages of the game, but you'll soon find yourself struggling if you don't
                        improve your technique. Follow these useful tips to get started down the right path so you and
                        your rescue team can save the day. Maybe you'll even discover what's behind your transformation
                        into a Pokémon.</p>

                    <p class="small-title">Choosing Your Partner</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">When the game begins, your answers to a brief series of questions will
                        determine which Pokémon you will play as during the game (though you can choose a different one,
                        if you like). You'll also be given the opportunity to choose another Pokémon who will join you
                        on your quest. Now, you could just choose your favorite Pokémon from the available selection to
                        be your teammate, but you'll have a much easier time of things if you select a Pokémon whose
                        type complements that of your character.</p>
                    <img style="margin: 0 5%;"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/video-games/_tiles/strategy/mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx/starters-guide/inline/01-en.jpg"
                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content">You certainly don't want to have a rescue team composed of two Pokémon whose
                        types have the same weaknesses. You should also consider choosing a partner who is strong
                        against Pokémon types that have an advantage over your character. For example, the Fire-type
                        Charmander is vulnerable to Rock-type attacks, so a Water- or Grass-type Pokémon would help
                        counter that weakness.
                    </p>

                    <p class="news-content">All that said, don't sweat it if you don't get your initial Pokémon pairing
                        exactly perfect from the start. As you play, you'll end up recruiting other Pokémon to your
                        rescue team, and your expanding roster will provide even more chances to optimize your team for
                        the challenges you'll face.</p>

                    <p class="small-title">Preparing for Dungeons</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">Heading into a dungeon is kind of a big deal. Unless you use an Escape Orb,
                        you can't leave a dungeon until you complete your objective or until you're knocked out (bonus
                        tip: you don't want that to happen). You'll find useful items within dungeons, but due to the
                        randomly generated nature of these areas, don't count on coming across the item you need when
                        you need it. Since you can never be sure what you're in for, it's extremely important to make
                        sure your rescue team is ready for any situation before entering the fray.</p>
                    <img style="margin: 0 5%;"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/video-games/_tiles/strategy/mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx/starters-guide/inline/02-en.jpg"
                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content">Always swing by Pokémon Square to stock up on supplies before heading out on
                        a job. Money (called Poké) that you've collected on previous outings should be used to purchase
                        supplies for the journey ahead. Items to heal negative status conditions can be crucial, and
                        drinks that boost your stats can give you a solid advantage. You can also stock up on damaging
                        items to throw at enemies from afar. Don't forget to snag some Max Elixirs—given the number of
                        enemies you'll encounter, there's a very real possibility of running out of PP on some of your
                        more powerful attacks. A Max Elixir will restore that PP so you're not stuck using weaker
                        attacks just as you delve into the deeper levels of a dungeon, where the danger increases.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">Also be aware that you must keep yourself well fed during your journey. If
                        your Pokémon's Belly gets empty while you're in a dungeon, you'll begin to lose health fast.
                        Bring some food along to nosh on as you explore. Every now and again, you'll come across a small
                        shop run by Kecleon in a dungeon. There's a good chance you won't have found enough money in
                        that dungeon alone to purchase anything, so you might want to bring some extra money into the
                        dungeon with you just in case you need it.</p>
                    <img style="margin: 0 5%;"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/video-games/_tiles/strategy/mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx/starters-guide/inline/03-en.jpg"
                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content">One of the quirks of dungeons is that if you're knocked out in one, you will
                        lose any items and money that you were holding at the time. Depositing goods and money in
                        Pokémon Square's Kangaskhan Storage and Felicity Bank will protect them while you're off
                        adventuring, with the trade-off that, well, you won't have access to them if you need them. You
                        must balance risk and reward when deciding what to bring and what to leave behind when you start
                        a quest—but never enter a dungeon unprepared.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Positioning Your Team</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">It might not be immediately apparent when you start your adventure, but
                        <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em> is a turn-based game. Every time you take a
                        step, use an item, or make an attack, it counts as a turn. Then, your teammates make their moves, 
                        and finally, any enemy Pokémon on the dungeon floor you're currently exploring do their thing. 
                        Each turn you take also decreases the amount of food in your Belly. Because of all this, it's
                        important to learn how to skillfully move around in dungeons to preserve precious food and to
                        maneuver your partners into position to attack enemies.</p>
                    </p>
                    <img style="margin: 0 5%;"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/video-games/_tiles/strategy/mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx/starters-guide/inline/04-en.jpg"
                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content">You'll also need to be aware of how your teammates follow you around the
                        dungeons. When you want them to be in a precise position, press the + Button anytime (even
                        during a battle) to control a different teammate. Note that this won't work with Pokémon who
                        have just joined your team in the course of your current dungeon trek. Alternatively, hold the B
                        Button while moving onto another Pokémon's space to switch positions with them. This can be
                        handy when you're trying to get someone to step on a stat-normalizing Wonder Tile. It's also
                        useful when you encounter an enemy in narrow corridors. If your partner is facing a Pokémon to
                        which they are vulnerable, you can quickly swap places with them to pull them out of immediate
                        danger. Likewise, you can use this trick to put your friend between you and the enemy if you
                        need a little breathing room or if you have a long-range attack at your disposal.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Knowing Your Combat Range</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">You'll encounter plenty of enemy Pokémon lurking about as you explore
                        dungeons. You'll likely have to battle them, of course, and you'll be much more effective if you
                        take advantage of your attacks' ranges. Each of your moves affects a set number of spaces around
                        you, and if your enemy is in one of those spaces, they'll take a hit. Many attacks simply hit
                        the space directly in front of you, but that's not always the case.</p>

                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p class="news-content">There are long-range attacks that can hit a target multiple spaces away
                        directly in front of you, while other moves will hit spaces adjacent to your character. There
                        are even moves that will affect every enemy in the room. Remember that attacks that hit multiple
                        adjacent spaces at once are much less effective when used in narrow corridors between rooms, so
                        be careful not to waste them there.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Manipulating Your Moves</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">You'll be able to learn new moves as you play through your adventures. As in
                        the main series of Pokémon RPGs, new moves will become available to you as you level up, and you
                        can learn new moves with TMs. TMs are available for purchase at Kecleon Wares, but you'll also
                        come across them in dungeons.</p>
                    <img style="margin: 0 5%;"

                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content">Another way to customize your Pokémon's moves is by linking them. Visit the
                        Gulpin Link Shop in Pokémon Square or use the Link Box item to connect two or more of your moves
                        together, allowing you to use a string of moves in a single turn. It's a great way to activate a
                        stat-altering move while also getting an attack in on your opponent. Try to link moves that have
                        the same range and a similar amount of PP to get the best use out of them. A downside of linking
                        moves is that your Belly will empty more rapidly when you use linked moves. Also, you'll use up
                        PP for all linked moves at once whenever you use them. Make sure you've brought along plenty of
                        food to refill your Belly and Max Elixirs to refill your moves' PP!</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Teammate Tactics</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">Although your teammates will follow you and attack on their own, you can
                        direct their actions by adjusting their tactics, accessible by selecting Tactics Meeting from
                        the X Menu. These are basic commands that your friends will follow. By default, your teammates'
                        tactics are set to “Let's go together,” but you can issue other orders, like “Follow me,” “Don't
                        use moves,” “Go after foes,” “Go the other way,” “Wait there,” and “Run away from enemies.”</p>

                    <p class="small-title">Beware of Trap Tiles</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">Dungeons are filled with peril, and there are few trickier situations to
                        navigate than treacherous trap tiles. These deceiving obstacles are normally hidden from sight,
                        disguised as floor tiles. Hidden, that is, until you step on them. There is a wide variety of
                        traps with all sorts of negative effects; some simply cause damage, while others inflict a
                        negative status condition, such as Sleep or Poisoned.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">More-devious traps will summon a swarm of enemies, seal off one of your
                        moves, lower the PP of one of your moves to zero, or prevent you from using an item in your
                        inventory. There are plenty of other trap tiles as well, and they usually spell bad news.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">Fortunately, you do have defenses against traps. The Trap Scarf item
                        prevents traps from activating if a Pokémon steps on them, and the Trapbust Orb destroys all
                        traps on the current dungeon floor. Tread carefully to keep your rescue team from suffering any
                        unnecessary consequences.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Learn the Terrain</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="news-content">In addition to trap tiles, there are other environmental elements within
                        dungeons to watch out for. Terrain and weather by themselves may not harm you, but they will
                        affect how you maneuver through each dungeon. Take note of your surroundings and adjust your
                        strategies.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">There are a few different types of dungeon terrain: Ground is the standard
                        terrain that you'll find in most dungeons. Any Pokémon can travel on this, of course. Water is
                        common, but Water-type Pokémon typically don't need to worry about it, as they can cross it with
                        ease. Likewise, magma will block the way for most everyone but Fire-type Pokémon.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">Weather doesn't prevent your rescue team from moving, but it can hinder
                        certain attacks and occasionally do damage to you, your teammates, and even enemy Pokémon.
                        Usually, dungeons will have clear weather, which has no effects, positive or negative. But you
                        will sometimes enter a dungeon floor that has one of the following weather conditions, which
                        should look somewhat familiar if you've played the main series of Pokémon RPGs.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">As you can see, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em> is a much deeper
                        game than it might initially appear to be. Start using these tips right away, though—the game
                        can get very difficult very quickly, and if you don't start thinking strategically early on, you
                        might be overwhelmed as the adventure progresses. But don't stress out too much. Even if you get
                        knocked out in a dungeon, another rescue team can come to your aid, or you can always give it
                        another go. Just be prepared, play thoughtfully, and maybe you'll solve the mystery of these
                        tricky dungeons!</p>
