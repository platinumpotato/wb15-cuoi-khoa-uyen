                        Pokémon
                    </p>
                    <p class="news-content">Pokémon TCG Prerelease tournaments let players be the first to get their
                        hands on the newest expansion and try out the latest cards in action. With the launch of the new
                        Sword & Shield Series, Prerelease tournaments will be your first chance to play with Pokémon
                        from the Galar region. Pokémon TCG: <em>Sword & Shield</em> Prerelease tournaments will be held January
                        25 – February 3, 2020, shortly before the expansion launches on February 7. In addition to
                        getting cards early, you'll be able to pick up 1 of 4 cool promo cards: Rillaboom, Frosmoth,
                        Galarian Perrserker, or Cinccino! Check with your local game store to see when they're hosting
                        one of these events.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">When you sit down to play at a Prerelease tournament, you'll receive a Build
                        & Battle Box containing a 23-card Evolution pack, which includes an exclusive foil promo card
                        and is designed to give you a strong foundation for building a new deck. Each box also includes
                        four 10-card booster packs from <em>Sword & Shield</em>. You'll use these cards, plus basic Energy
                        provided by the Tournament Organizer, to construct your own 40-card deck. You'll get to keep all
                        the cards from your Build & Battle Box, whether you use them in your deck or not. If you're
                        lucky, you might even open one of the new out-of-this-world Pokémon V or Pokémon VMAX.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">The promo card you'll receive is a cool collector's item, with a shiny foil
                        stamp marking it as a Prerelease promo. It can also be used in your deck, and you're likely to
                        wind up with plenty of cards that match its type. Take a look at the four promo cards available
                        at <em>Sword & Shield</em> Prerelease tournaments, and get some tips to make the most of the one you
                        receive.</p>

                    <p class="small-title">Rillaboom (SWSH006)</p>
                    <hr>
                    <img class="news-img"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/trading-card-game/_tiles/swsh01/prerelease/inline/01-en.png"
                        alt="">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;" class="news-content">Sound off with the Grass-type Rillaboom, the
                        final Evolution of Grookey. Its
                        Voltage Beat Ability is super useful no matter the tournament format, allowing you to quickly
                        get lots of Energy onto your Pokémon by grabbing 2 Grass Energy cards from your deck and
                        attaching them to 1 of your Pokémon. Rillaboom will happily take that Energy for itself so it
                        can power up its hard-hitting Hammer In attack. You're less likely to come across super-powerful
                        Pokémon V in Prerelease tournaments, so 140 damage is likely to be enough to Knock Out a lot of
                        foes in one hit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small-title">Frosmoth (SWSH007)</p>
                    <hr>
                    <img class="news-img-left"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/trading-card-game/_tiles/swsh01/prerelease/inline/02-en.png"
                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Like Rillaboom, the chilly Frosmoth helps keep
                        your Pokémon full of Energy
                        with its Ice Dance Ability. It lets you attach a Water Energy card from your hand to your
                        Benched Pokémon—and keep doing that as often as you like during your turn, powering them up
                        quickly so they're ready to attack. Frosmoth is a Stage 1 Pokémon, meaning it's even easier for
                        it to show off its moves. And remember, it doesn't have to be Active to use this Ability;
                        Frosmoth can make an impact even when it's out of the spotlight.</p>

                    <p class="small-title">Galarian Perrserker (SWSH008)</p>
                    <hr>
                    <img class="news-img"
                        src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/trading-card-game/_tiles/swsh01/prerelease/inline/03-en.png"
                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">The Meowth of the Galar region take on a hairy
                        new look and evolve in a new
                        direction—Galarian Perrserker! This Pokémon sharpens the attacks of any of your Metal-type
                        Pokémon (including itself) by making their attacks do 20 more damage. In a Prerelease
                        tournament, every little bit helps, and a couple of these Pokémon on your Bench can make a
                        massive difference in battle. At 120 HP, Galarian Perrserker is rather durable, too, making it
                        potentially effective in the Active Spot and attacking with Metal Claw for a boosted 90 damage.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small-title">Cinccino (SWSH009)</p>
                    <hr>
                    <img class="news-img-left"

                        alt="">
                    <p class="news-content" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">The only Pokémon from this lineup who wasn't
                        discovered in the Galar region,
                        Cinccino has some useful skills to contribute to your Prerelease deck. Its Make Do Ability lets
                        you turn over your hand by discarding a card to draw two more. Remember that you have only 40
                        cards in a Prerelease deck, so make sure you don't draw yourself out of cards. Speed up your
                        Energy attachment by discarding an Energy with the Ability, then getting it onto a Benched
                        Pokémon with Cinccino's Energy Assist attack—which also does 40 damage.</p>
