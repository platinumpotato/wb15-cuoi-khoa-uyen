                    <p class="news-content">When you first face off against a Master Ball Tier opponent in Ranked
                        Battles or watch exquisitely trained Pokémon in tournament streams, it can be an eye-opening
                        experience. Pokémon in high-level battles deal jaw-dropping damage or casually brush off massive
                        attacks. You may think that these Trainers are doing something you'll never be able to do, but
                        there's nothing going on that you can't replicate—these Pokémon are so effective in battle
                        simply because they've been carefully trained.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">With a little effort, anyone can train their Pokémon to stand out in even
                        the toughest battles, and in <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Pokémon Shield</em>, getting Pokémon
                        in tip-top condition is easier than ever. While building a team full of powerful Pokémon
                        previously required wearing a track into the ground from cycling around Pokémon Nurseries, you
                        can now take a Pokémon straight from a Max Raid Battle into competitive play just by leveling it
                        up, using a mint, and Hyper Training with a Bottle Cap or two.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">Read on to find out which items you might want to get before you get
                        started, like a Destiny Knot or Bottle Caps. Then we'll give some tips on catching Pokémon,
                        hatching Pokémon, and training Pokémon and some advice on when each might save you time. We'll
                        even go into how to quickly make money in order to purchase nutritious drinks and other items to

                    <p class="news-content">It's probably best to enjoy the main story using whichever Pokémon you have
                        the most fun with before worrying about training up top-tier competitors for competitive
                        battles. After you become Champion and crush the first few rounds in the Battle Tower, you can
                        then turn your focus toward developing competitive Pokémon. It's at this point that you'll
                        unlock the Judge function, which is your means of evaluating individual strengths of your
                        Pokémon. Individual strengths represent the affinity each individual Pokémon has for each stat.
                        A Pokémon with a higher individual strength for Attack will have its Attack increase faster and
                        have a higher maximum Attack stat than a Pokémon of the same species with a lower individual
                        strength for Attack. Not surprisingly, to optimize a Pokémon's performance in battle, you should
                        shoot for a “Best” individual strength in each stat that Pokémon will be using.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">In addition to the stat increases your Pokémon derives from individual
                        strengths, there are a few other factors that go into preparing a Pokémon for competitive
                        battles. Aim for Pokémon that have all the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="news-content"><strong>“Best” individual strengths in each stat.</strong> You can use
                            Hyper Training to bring a Pokémon that didn't start with perfect potential up to par.</li>
                        <li class="news-content"><strong>A Nature that suits the role you plan for your Pokémon to play
                                in battle.</strong> Your Pokémon's Nature increases the growth of one of its stats (that
                            stat's name is red on your Pokémon's summary screen) at the expense of another stat (which
                            has its name in blue). You can give your Pokémon a mint to change the stats affected by its
                            Nature.
                        </li>
                        <li class="news-content"><strong>The Ability you want your Pokémon to have.</strong> Pokémon
                            typically have one of two potential Abilities when discovered in the wild, and Pokémon you
                            catch in Max Raid Battles may instead have their Hidden Ability, which is rarer. You can
                            give your Pokémon an Ability Capsule to swap between its two more common Abilities (like
                            Growlithe's Intimidate and Flash Fire), but it won't be able to help a Pokémon swap to or
                            from its Hidden Ability (such as Growlithe's Hidden Ability, Justified).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="news-content">There are also several useful items you may want to acquire to aid in
                        Pokémon development. We'll explain what some of them are for as we go. Most of these items cost
                        BP, which you can earn by battling in the Battle Tower. It's probably best to buy these items
                        only as they're needed. Veteran Pokémon Trainers will note the lack of the “Power” items (like
                        the Power Bracer) below, for although such items can still be useful, they're no longer as
                        essential as they were during past adventures.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">Hatching Eggs was once unquestionably the best way to develop top-tier
                        Pokémon, but that familiar method is not always the most efficient option these days. Now, the
                        fastest way to get a Pokémon with perfect individual strengths is to catch a Pokémon that
                        already has strong individual strengths in most of its stats and then doing Hyper Training at
                        the Battle Tower by using Bottle Caps. Hyper Training is possible only for Pokémon that are Lv.
                        100, and the trade-off of this speedy approach is that it'll burn through some of your rarer
                        items quickly. It's also a great choice for Pokémon that have no gender or are always the same
                        gender, which can be a little frustrating to find Eggs for.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">If you don't already have a Pokémon of the species you desire with high
                        individual strengths, the easiest way to get one is from a Max Raid Battle. This is also
                        necessary if you want that Pokémon to have a Hidden Ability, because Pokémon you find roaming
                        Galar will never have their Hidden Abilities. Max Raid Battles are also useful because you can
                        earn Exp. Candy XL, Exp. Candy L, and Rare Candy, all of which making leveling up Pokémon
                        quicker. Check out our <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Pokémon Shield</em> Max Raid Battle Tips
                        for more on Max Raid Battles.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">Once you catch a Pokémon in a Max Raid Battle, check out its Nature,
                        individual strengths, and Ability by going to the Pokémon Boxes and using the Judge function. If
                        the Pokémon has the Ability you're looking for and “Best” individual strengths in many of the
                        stats you need, skip hatching Eggs and power up this Pokémon instead. If it also has the desired
                        Nature, you've really hit the gold mine and should <em>definitely</em> power this Pokémon up
                        instead of
                        hatching a new one. And if you'd like to battle using a Pokémon capable of Gigantamaxing, this
                        is the <em>only</em> means of obtaining high individual strengths, since the Gigantamax Factor
                        doesn't
                        pass down to Pokémon Eggs.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">Any Pokémon caught in Max Raid Battles will usually be a pretty high level,
                        so it shouldn't take too much Exp. Candy to help it get to Lv. 100. Once it gets there, you can
                        go to the Battle Tower and give Bottle Caps to the gentleman behind the desk on the far right to
                        max out the individual strengths your Pokémon isn't already “Best” at. Once you do, you'll see
                        its new designation is “Hyper trained!”—this confers the same stats as “Best” but won't pass
                        down to any Eggs. You can also use a super-rare Gold Bottle Cap, which will increase all of a
                        Pokémon's individual strengths to the max.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">As we mentioned earlier, to shift the stat effects from your Pokémon's
                        Nature to be more to your liking, you should give your Pokémon a mint, which will cause it to
                        take on the effects of the Nature in the mint's name. For instance, if you'd like your Rotom to
                        be excellent at damaging foes with special moves, you could give it a Modest Mint (which
                        promotes Sp. Atk at the expense of Attack). Mints cost 50 BP and Bottle Caps cost 25 BP from
                        vendors in the Battle Tower in Wyndon.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">Even as Hyper Training has become much more accessible, hatching Eggs you
                        receive from the Pokémon Nursery still has its place. Eggs are great when you don't have a
                        high-potential Pokémon of the species you're looking for but you do have a bunch of Ditto or
                        male Pokémon with great individual strengths (check out the <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and
                        <em>Pokémon Shield</em> Max
                        Raid Battle Tips for a den with lots of Ditto). Perhaps the best use of the Pokémon Nursery is
                        to easily get a Pokémon with your desired Nature, saving you 50 BP you'd otherwise spend on a
                        mint. Hatching Eggs for Pokémon with perfect individual strengths tends to be much more
                        time-consuming than Hyper Training, but the advantage is that you significantly cut down on the
                        number of hard-to-get items you have to use to reach the same goal.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">In <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Pokémon Shield</em>, there are two Pokémon
                        Nurseries, both
                        functionally the same—one on Route 5 and one toward the center of the Wild Area in the Bridge
                        Field. To have an Egg appear at the Pokémon Nursery, you must leave two of your own Pokémon with
                        the attendant—one male and one female of the same Egg Group, or a Ditto and any Pokémon from any
                        other Egg Group except the No Eggs Discovered group. There are 15 Egg Groups consisting of
                        Pokémon that tend to have similar characteristics, and every Pokémon belongs to at least one.
                        For example, the Mineral Group features lots of inorganic, sturdy Pokémon, such as Onix,
                        Solrock, and Baltoy. When all conditions are met, you'll eventually find an Egg that will hatch
                        into the earliest of the female Pokémon's (or the non-Ditto's) Evolutionary line. You can find a
                        full listing of Egg Groups in <em>Pokémon Sword</em> & <em>Pokémon Shield: The Official Galar

                    <p class="news-content">There are four main benefits to leaving Pokémon in the Nursery as you work
                        toward training a team of top-notch Pokémon.</p>

                        Nursery. Then, find a Ditto or compatible male Pokémon with a Timid Nature, and give that
                        Pokémon an Everstone before you place it in the Nursery. Each resulting Egg you find will
                        contain a Pichu, the earliest in Raichu's Evolutionary line, that has the Timid Nature. That's

                        strengths that match those of the Pokémon that were in the Nursery when you found their Egg. If
                        you have either of the Nursery Pokémon hold a Destiny Knot, <em>five</em> of their individual
                        strengths
                        will pass down instead, leaving only one fully to chance. If you can put two Pokémon in the
                        Nursery that between them have maximum individual strengths in each stat you're looking for, you
                        should eventually end up with a Pokémon that inherits the best individual strengths from both
                        Pokémon. You can increase your odds by continually replacing the Pokémon in the Nursery with new
                        ones that have better and better individual strengths.</p>
                    <p class="news-content"><strong>Getting Egg Moves.</strong> In the past, Egg Moves—moves that the
                        Pokémon aren't normally be able to learn through more common means, like leveling up or using
                        TMs—could be learned only by newly hatched Pokémon, but you can be a little more flexible in
                        Galar. The most common method to obtain an Egg Move is to start out with a female Pokémon from
                        your desired species and a compatible Pokémon that knows the Egg Move you're looking for. This
                        will produce an Egg of the species you want that knows the Egg Move.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">But there's a new method in <em>Pokémon Sword</em> <em>and Pokémon
                            Shield</em>. You can now
                        teach Egg Moves to existing Pokémon instead of starting anew. Make sure the Pokémon you want to
                        learn the Egg Move knows three or fewer moves, then leave it at the Pokémon Nursery with a
                        Pokémon of the same species that knows the desired Egg Move. (Remember that the
                        jack-of-all-trades behind the counter on the left in any Pokémon Center will help a Pokémon
                        forget a move.) After just a short while, the empty move slot will be replaced with the Egg
                        Move. This is also the only way to teach Pokémon with the Gigantamax Factor Egg Moves!</p>
                    <p class="news-content"><strong>Swapping Abilities.</strong> You can also hatch Eggs to obtain
                        Pokémon of the same
                        species but that have a different Ability, although the process isn't totally reliable.
                        Typically, Eggs have the same Ability that the female Pokémon in the Nursery had (or the
                        non-Ditto Pokémon, if you're working with Ditto), but sometimes an Egg will hatch with a
                        different Ability instead. Likewise, an Egg that can inherit a Hidden Ability could also inherit
                        one of the more common Abilities instead, but a Hidden Ability will never appear if neither of
                        the Pokémon in the Nursery already has it.</p>

                    <p class="news-content">Once you have the Pokémon you want to train ready, the final step is to
                        raise its base points. Base points are underlying values that help determine a Pokémon's six
                        major stats—HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed. They start at zero but can be
                        increased by defeating Pokémon, participating in certain Poké Jobs, or using specific kinds of
                        items. You won't be able to train your Pokémon to have the highest amount of base points in
                        every stat because there is a limit to how many total base points you can have across all six
                        stats. This limit of total base points allows you to either hit the maximum in two stats with a
                        tiny bit left over for a third or spread your Pokémon's training more evenly across a greater
                        number of stats.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">We suggest focusing on maximizing two of your Pokémon's stats. For Pokémon
                        intended to focus on attacking, usually Speed and either Attack or Sp. Atk work well, and for
                        more defensively oriented Pokémon, usually HP and either Defense or Sp. Def work well.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">By far the fastest and simplest way to increase a Pokémon's stats is by
                        using nutritious drinks, which can be purchased in the front Pokémon Center in Wyndon. Give your
                        Pokémon 26 drinks that match the two stats you'd like them to excel in—for instance, HP Up and
                        Protein if you'd like the Pokémon to have great HP and Attack—and you'll be well on your way.
                        You can see if a stat is maxed out by checking the second tab of the Pokémon's summary screen
                        (which features the stat graph) and then pressing the X Button to view the second graph. Once a
                        Pokémon has the full allotment of base points in a stat, there will be a sparkling effect around
                        the stat's name. If you accidentally train the wrong stats for your Pokémon, you can reduce them
                        by using a Qualot Berry (for Defense) or other, similar Berries.</p>
                    <p class="news-content">Train your Pokémon's stats fully before putting your Pokémon in your party,
                        because if you defeat any Pokémon that awards Exp. Points, your Pokémon will gain base points
                        based on the species of the defeated Pokémon. If you intend to do Hyper Training with a Pokémon
                        and want to gain Exp. Points by defeating enemy Pokémon instead of by using items exclusively,
                        make sure to use the nutritious drinks before leveling the Pokémon up.</p>

                        earn some extra cash. Here are two quick ways to earn lots of money in Pokémon Sword and Pokémon

                        made available as a
                        Mystery Gift until January 15, 2020. Meowth isn't the most ferocious battler, so you probably
                        won't want it for your tournament team, but it's truly fantastic at helping you acquire shiny
                        objects. Its G-Max Move, G-Max Gold Rush, scatters coins all over the area, like a much more
                        powerful Pay Day. If you give one of the Pokémon participating in battle an Amulet Coin to hold
                        and have Meowth at Lv. 100, you'll net an additional 99,999 in cash on top of your usual prize
                        money every time your Meowth successfully uses G-Max Gold Rush three times in the same battle.
                        You can Gigantamax Meowth only in certain battles, but you can compete in as many Champion
                        tournaments in Wyndon as you'd like after you become Champion, so you can Gigantamax Meowth in
                        those tournaments to quickly earn lots of dough.</p>
